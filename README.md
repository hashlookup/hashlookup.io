# hashlookup project

The [hashlookup project](https://github.com/hashlookup) provides a complete set of open source tools and [open standards](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-dulaunoy-hashlookup-format/) to lookup hash values against known database of files. Hashlookup helps to improve and speed-up Digital Forensic and Incident Response (DFIR) by providing a readily-accessible list of known files metadata published.

### Tools using hashlookup services or dataset

### Maintained by hashlookup.io project

- [hashlookup-forensic-analyser](https://github.com/hashlookup/hashlookup-forensic-analyser) Analyse a forensic target (such as a directory) to find and report files found and not found from CIRCL hashlookup public service or offline with Bloom filters. This tool can help a digital forensic investigator to know the context, origin of specific files during a digital forensic investigation.
- [hashlookup-gui](https://github.com/hashlookup/hashlookup-gui) provides a multi-platform Graphical User Interface for hashlookup.
- [PyHashlookup](https://github.com/hashlookup/PyHashlookup) is a client API in Python to query CIRCL hashlookup.
- [MISP module hashlookup expansion](https://misp.github.io/misp-modules/expansion/#hashlookup) is a [MISP module](https://www.misp-project.org/) allowing to lookup and expand from hashlookup.
- [a-ray-grass](https://github.com/hashlookup/a-ray-grass) is a yara module that provides support for DCSO format bloom filters in yara. In the context of hashlookup, it allows quickly discard known files "pour s√©parer le grain de l'ivraie" from hashlookup Bloom filters.
